# README Generator

I will help you create a comprehensive README for your project.

## Guardrails
- Analyze the actual project before writing
- Don't include features that don't exist
- Keep it up to date with the codebase
- Make it scannable and useful

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Project
Gather information:
- Read package.json or equivalent
- Check existing documentation
- Understand project structure
- Identify main features

### 2. Understand Audience
Ask if needed:
- Who will read this? (developers, users, both)
- What do they need to know first?
- Any specific sections required?

### 3. Structure README
Include relevant sections:
- **Title & Description**: What it does
- **Badges**: Build status, version, license
- **Quick Start**: Get running fast
- **Installation**: Detailed setup
- **Usage**: How to use it
- **API/Commands**: Reference docs
- **Contributing**: How to help
- **License**: Legal info

### 4. Write Content
For each section:
- Be concise but complete
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots for UI
- Link to detailed docs

### 5. Verify
- All commands work
- Links are valid
- Examples are current

## Principles
- Lead with value (what does this do for me?)
- Make the quick start actually quick
- Keep examples copy-pasteable
