# New Feature

I will help you implement a complete feature from start to finish.

## Guardrails
- Understand requirements before coding
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Include tests with the feature
- Document as you build

## Steps

### 1. Understand Requirements
Ask clarifying questions:
- What should this feature do?
- Who will use it?
- Any mockups or specifications?
- What's the acceptance criteria?

### 2. Plan Implementation
Break down the work:
- Database changes needed
- API endpoints to create
- UI components to build
- Integration points

### 3. Implement Backend
Build the foundation:
- Database schema/migrations
- API endpoints
- Business logic
- Input validation

### 4. Implement Frontend
Build the UI:
- Components
- State management
- API integration
- Error handling

### 5. Add Tests
Cover the feature:
- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for API
- E2E tests for critical paths

### 6. Verify
- Feature works as expected
- Tests pass
- No regressions

## Principles
- Build vertically (full slice) not horizontally
- Get something working before polishing
- Commit frequently with clear messages
