# Landing Page Creation

I will help you build a high-converting, visually stunning landing page that adapts to your project's tech stack.

## Guardrails
- Never assume a specific framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- Detect project stack before suggesting implementations
- Favor bold, distinctive design over safe, generic choices
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Keep accessibility in mind (contrast ratios, semantic HTML)

## Steps

### 1. Understand Requirements
Ask clarifying questions:
- What is the product/service being promoted?
- Who is the target audience?
- What is the primary call-to-action (signup, purchase, demo)?
- What sections are needed (hero, features, pricing, testimonials)?
- Is there an existing brand guide or color palette?

### 2. Analyze Project Stack
Detect the existing setup:
- **Framework**: Check for React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or static HTML
- **Styling**: Check for Tailwind, CSS Modules, Sass, styled-components, or vanilla CSS
- **Animation**: Check for existing animation libraries (Framer Motion, GSAP, AOS)
- **Existing patterns**: Look at existing components for conventions to follow

If no existing setup or unclear, ask the user which stack they prefer.

### 3. Plan Section Structure
A high-converting landing page typically includes:

**Above the fold:**
- Hero section with compelling headline and value proposition
- Primary CTA button
- Hero image, illustration, or background visual

**Below the fold:**
- Social proof (logos, testimonials, trust badges)
- Features/benefits grid (3-4 key points with icons)
- How it works (step-by-step process)
- Pricing (if applicable)
- FAQ section
- Final CTA with email capture or signup form

### 4. Create Components
For each section, create a reusable component:
- Follow the project's existing component patterns
- Use the project's styling approach consistently
- Add appropriate animations for entrance effects
- Ensure semantic HTML structure for accessibility

### 5. Assemble Page
Compose all sections in the main page file:
- Arrange sections in logical flow
- Add consistent spacing between sections
- Ensure smooth scrolling and navigation

### 6. Verify
- Test responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Check contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Verify all CTAs are prominent and clickable
- Test page load performance

## Principles

### Design
- **Typography**: Large, bold headings; generous line height for body text
- **Color**: Primary brand color for CTAs; subtle background gradients
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding between sections (80-120px on desktop)
- **Dark mode**: Consider adding dark mode support

### Performance
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- Use system fonts or optimized web fonts

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Alt text for images
- Sufficient color contrast
- Keyboard navigation support

## Reference
- Check existing components in the project
- Look for design tokens in the global CSS
- Review any existing brand guidelines
