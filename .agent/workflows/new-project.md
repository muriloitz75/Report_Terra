# New Project

I will help you scaffold a new project that adapts to your preferred tech stack.

## Guardrails
- Never assume a specific framework
- Ask about requirements before scaffolding
- Use official project generators when available
- Set up proper project structure from the start

## Steps

### 1. Understand Requirements
Ask clarifying questions:
- What type of project? (web app, API, CLI, library)
- Any framework preferences? (React, Vue, Django, Express, etc.)
- TypeScript or JavaScript?
- What features are needed initially?

### 2. Choose Stack
Based on requirements, suggest appropriate stack:
- Frontend: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or static
- Backend: Node/Express, Python/FastAPI, Go, etc.
- Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite
- Styling: Tailwind, CSS Modules, styled-components

### 3. Scaffold Project
Use official generators:
- React: `npx create-react-app` or `npx create-vite`
- Next.js: `npx create-next-app`
- Vue: `npm create vue@latest`
- Express: manual setup or generator
- Python: `pip install` + virtual env

### 4. Configure Essentials
Set up:
- Git initialization
- Editor config (.editorconfig, .prettierrc)
- Linting (ESLint, Pylint)
- TypeScript config if applicable

### 5. Verify
- Run the development server
- Confirm project structure is correct
- Test basic functionality

## Principles
- Start minimal, add complexity as needed
- Follow framework conventions
- Set up proper tooling from day one
